#RESTaurant

Built with Ruby on Rails. This app is a custom table management system for employees of a "RESTaurant."

## Employees can...
* Create an account
* Log in and out
* Add new parties
* Manage a party's order by drinks, meals, and desserts
* Close a tab
* View all current parties
* View all past parties
* Add, edit and delete items from the menu

## Notes
* A table # can only be used once at a given time
* An order begins with 'drinks'
* When the drink order is submitted, the employee moves to meals, desserts, etc.
* If the employee switches between parties, they can return to another party's order wherever they left off
